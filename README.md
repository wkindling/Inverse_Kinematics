# Inverse_Kinematics
Two simple demos about Inverse-Kinematics using **CCD** (cyclic coordinate decent).

It should be pointed out that I use Spherical coordinate system to describe the position of joints (because it is easy to implement lol). Consequently, these projects cannot be used in general.

I may change the two demos into Euler angle representation in my spare time.

Hints: You can use Rodriguez's Rotation Formula to rotate the end bone to the target position:)
